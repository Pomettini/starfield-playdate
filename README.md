# Starfield\*

Basically a port of the [Daniel Shiffman's Starfield p5.js sketch](https://thecodingtrain.com/challenges/1-starfield) for the [Playdate](https://play.date/)

Just turn the crank forward to accelerate. Have fun!

## Installation

First you need to install the [crank command line tool](https://github.com/rtsuk/crank) then run

    crank run --release

Or if you have a device attatched

    crank run --release --device

\* The name has nothing to do with the game [Starfield](https://bethesda.net/en/game/starfield)
